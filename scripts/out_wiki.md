Simplification of special casesâ€‹
Another use of the Iverson bracket is to simplify equations with special cases. For example, the formula
${\displaystyle \sum _{1\leq k\leq n \atop \gcd(k,n)=1}\!\!k={\frac {1}{2}}n\varphi (n)}$
is valid for n > 1 but is off by 
1
2
 for n = 1. To get an identity valid for all positive integers n (i.e., all values for which $\phi (n)$ is defined), a correction term involving the Iverson bracket may be added:
${\displaystyle \sum _{1\leq k\leq n \atop \gcd(k,n)=1}\!\!k={\frac {1}{2}}n(\varphi (n)+[n=1])}$
